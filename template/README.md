# CSS Types Package for xyz-normal

This package provides type-safe CSS units for xyz-normal directly from the specifications to your code.

## Installation

You can install this package using npm:

```bash
npm install xyz-kebab@versionNumber
```

## SemVer

This project does not respect semantic versioning as almost every change could potentially break a project, though we try to minimize removing types.
